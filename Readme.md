# Visualization Portfolio

Below are highlights and project samples related to my understanding of various softwares and code languages.

## Tableau | Data Visualization

Seen below:  

A Tableau dashboard comprised of e-commerce data. Built in functionality includes a dynamic filtering system that allows you to seamlessly drill down by either city or customer, as well as a filtering system on the right hand side that allows for you to plot filtered data directly on a map viz. Lastly, there is functionality to download a JPEG/powerpoint file copy directly onto your computer.

## Tableau | Data Visualization

Seen below:  

A presentation slide element that was used alongside data tables to show the positioning of North American producers relative to higher demand regions. The dual-axis consisted of a heat map of annual product demand alongside a bubble map illustrating producer location/production capacity.

## Excel / Mekko Graphics | Data Visualization

Seen below:  

A Mekko Graphics slide element that highlighted global product trade flows over the span of a given year. The project required the integration of multiple datasets using Python scripting and Excel index_match functions.
