# My Portfolio



Below are highlights and project samples related to my understanding of various softwares and code languages.


## Python | Data Cleaning and Development of Analysis Packages

Seen below:  A code example where I cleaned and re-organized multiple e-commerce databases into a usable data package showing granular order data. I also established code that allowed for a quick query, cutting the file size for ease of use in Excel or Tableau.

## Tableau | Dual Axis Mapping

Seen below:  

A presentation slide element that was used alongside data tables to show the positioning of North American producers relative to higher demand regions. The dual-axis consisted of a heat map of annual product demand alongside a bubble map illustrating producer location/production capacity.

## Excel | Pivot Tables and Dashboards 

Seen below:  

An analytical dashboard that utilized advanced pivot table and filtering functions as a means of seeing monthly sales premiums and tons by selling location, product, and transport mode, allowing the ability to analyze monthly sales metrics and determine how realized pricing at various locations compared to industry benchmarks over time.

## Excel / Mekko Graphics | Charts and Data Organization

Seen below:  

A Mekko Graphics slide element that highlighted global product trade flows over the span of a given year. The project required the integration of multiple datasets using Python scripting and Excel index_match functions.
